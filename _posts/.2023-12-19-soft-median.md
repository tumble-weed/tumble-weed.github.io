title: The Soft-Median Filter?
---

We are given an (odd) $2N + 1$ items, $\{x_1,x_2,...x_{2N + 1}\}$.  The median of the set $m$, is a number that has the same number of elements to its left (smaller than it), as to its right (larger than it). 

Said in another way, it is larger than $N$ members and smaller than $N$ members of the set.

We use the $\sigma = tanh(y) = \frac{1 - e^{-y}}{1 + e^{-y}}$ as a soft sign function. note whenever $ y < 0$, $-1 <\sigma(y) < 0$ and $0 <\sigma(y) < 1$ otherwise
